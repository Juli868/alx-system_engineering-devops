The design with 2 web servers is a bit better than the previous one where there are ny ne server. The need to add an additional server is due to if you have a one server it will lead to overloading the server since all the tasks needed to be done on the server side is done by that lone server, i.e: all hmtl requests, all database information retriaval is done by that server. which leads to late responses. To handle that we introduce a new server to help in providing the database responces and a load balancer such that in case of heavy traffic the requests are eveny balanced.
